If the temperature is increased on the thermostat the temperature at the top of the building is uncomfortable for both the team and customers and just about provides an adequate temperature in the lower offices.

•	Outward leaning bricks to the chimney stacks rebedded and the chimney stacks repointed
•	On page 7 there is work detailed to removed dangerous steel
•	On page 8 there is work to holed tarmacadam and loose rear door step


There are some further items that are not on the Engie schedule which we would also like completing

•	There is a free cable under the work surface in the kitchen where the washer/fridge would go. This serves the cooker point. This should be secured/trunked to avoid being damaged when the appliances are moved.
•	Two cables with 3 point plugs leave the kitchen adjacent a single socket. One serves an outside light and the other an extension in the lean to/garage. Both should be removed and the hole filled in. If you still require an outside light it should be installed correctly.
•	The sink waste outlet need pest proofing on the external wall.
•	The chimney breast to the living room should have a vent fitted in the hole left by the removal of the heating appliance.
